# Basic scraping

We explore how scraping works, covering making some soup from a website URL, finding a unique identifier for the content you're after using the inspector, and finally extracting it.

# Selenium

Some websites have some javascript functionality that blocks you from immediately getting the information you want, for example, by having to click a button to show a table.
Here we use a normal app testing tool, selenium, to act as a webdriver, giving us the functionality necessary to obtain our information.
Think of it as a browser bot instance, it opens a browser and you use code to tell it what to click etc.
